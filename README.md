Portable Linux is a tool that lets you create bootable USB and
removable drives using popular Live CDs based on Casper.  Portable
Linux sports some unique features:

1. The live setups created by this program let you use the remaining
   disk space on your USB dri ve to store and transport files between
   computers, as usual.

2. What's more, if your distribution supports persistence, the files
   and settings you edit on your live Linux distribution are persisted
   across reboots.

3. Finally, you can access the area used to store your files just fine
   from within your Linux distribution.

So you can create your live Linux distro, install a couple of codecs
and applications on it, and you've got a complete multimedia center on
your pocket!

Supported distributions at the moment include all the Ubuntu variants.

It is free software distributed under the GPL version 3, and it uses
the powerful Parted partitioning software.

## Requirements

Portable Linux requires the following to run:

- Python
- The GTK+ bindings for Python
- The libglade bindings for Python
- sfdisk from the util-linux-ng package
- Administrative privileges (root access) on the machine you're
  running it

Additionally, you must have at least one compatible (Casper-based) ISO
