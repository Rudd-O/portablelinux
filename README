= Portable Linux - the bootable Linux creator =

Portable Linux is a tool that lets you create bootable USB and removable drives using popular Live CDs based on Casper.  Supported distributions at the moment include all the Ubuntu variants.

It is free software distributed under the GPL version 3, and it uses the powerful Parted partitioning software.
